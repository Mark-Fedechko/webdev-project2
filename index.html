    <h1>About Me</h1> 
			<p>I am a 3rd year student majoring in Information Technology Management. I am from the west suburbs of chicago. I love nature and exploring it through hiking or any other physical activity. Fun fact about me is that I will bike across America this summer!</p>
    <h2>Journey of Hope</h2>
			<ul>
					<li>I am biking across America to raise support for the Ability Experiance, a non profit organization that dedicates itself on helping individuals with disabilities.</li>
					<li>I will be bike from Seattle, Washington to Washington D.C. I am very excited to work towards this awseome trip.</li>
					<li>The Journey of Hope is a very rare opportunity only given to few people, only 50-60 people a year commit themselves to this goal. I am very glad to participate this year in it.</li>
